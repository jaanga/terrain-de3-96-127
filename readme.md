## Concept

Provide digital elevation heightmaps to an accuracy of three seconds in a format and with methods 
so that entry and intermediate level programmers may quickly and easily create new and interesting 3D cartography.

## Source and Credits

The data in this repository was sourced from Jonathan de Ferranti's web site: [Viewfinder Panoramas]( http://www.viewfinderpanoramas.org/dem3.html ).

Ferranti's data was converted from binary HGT files to PNG files using [GDAL]( http://www.gdal.org/ ) and [OSGeo]( http://www.osgeo.org/ ).

And, of course, none of this would be possible without GitHub.
